Starting Router


Phase  1  : 5453 unrouted;      REAL time: 12 secs 

Phase  2  : 5182 unrouted;      REAL time: 12 secs 

Phase  3  : 1437 unrouted;      REAL time: 13 secs 

Phase  4  : 2975 unrouted; (Setup:5410812, Hold:0, Component Switching Limit:0)     REAL time: 21 secs 
WARNING:Route:441 - The router has detected a very high timing score (5410812) for this design. It is extremely unlikely
   the router will be able to meet your timing requirements. To prevent excessive run time the router will change
   strategy. The router will now work to completely route this design but not to improve timing. This behavior will
   allow you to use the Static Timing Report and FPGA Editor to isolate the paths with timing problems. The cause of
   this behavior is either overly difficult constraints, or issues with the implementation or synthesis of logic in the
   critical timing path. If you would prefer the router continue trying to meet timing and you are willing to accept a
   long run time set the option "-xe c" to override the present behavior.

Phase  5  : 0 unrouted; (Setup:5848369, Hold:0, Component Switching Limit:0)     REAL time: 22 secs

WARNING:Route:455 - CLK Net:cont1/PS_FSM_FFd1 may have excessive skew because 
      1 CLK pins and 10 NON_CLK pins failed to route using a CLK template.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 5832812 (Setup: 5832812, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

WARNING:Par:468 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
   Route Static Timing Report"). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to
   ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go to
   either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or "
   TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 2

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
